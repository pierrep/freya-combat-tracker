# Freya Combat Tracker

A local desktop combat tracker for fifth edition (2024 rules), built with C++20 and Qt 6 Widgets. 5E compatible.

Phase 1 is a roster you can use: a Dashboard, a Characters page where you add, edit, and delete characters, and placeholder Monsters and Combat pages.

## Layout

| Path | Target | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/core` | `combat_core` (static library) | C++ standard library only |
| `src/data` | `combat_data` (static library) | `combat_core`, nlohmann/json |
| `src/ui` | `combat_app` (executable `freya-combat-tracker`) | `combat_core`, `combat_data`, Qt 6 Widgets |
| `tests/core`, `tests/data` | `core_tests`, `data_tests` | No Qt; run without a display |

## Build

Requirements: CMake 3.25+, Ninja, a C++20 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 17+, Apple Clang, or MSVC 2022), and Qt 6.8+ (official installer or [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall)). nlohmann/json is used from the system if CMake finds it, otherwise fetched at configure time.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/src/ui/freya-combat-tracker
```

To build only the Qt-free libraries and tests, pass `-DCOMBAT_TRACKER_BUILD_APP=OFF`. Warnings are errors by default; pass `-DCOMBAT_TRACKER_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF` to relax that.

## Saved data

Characters are saved to `characters.json` (`schemaVersion` 1) in the per-user app data folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CombatTracker/`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/combat-tracker/` (or `~/.local/share/combat-tracker/`)
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\CombatTracker\`

Every edit is saved right away by writing a temporary file and renaming it over the old one. If the file cannot be read, the app shows the error and leaves the file untouched.
